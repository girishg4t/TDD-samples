Implementation
Internally the queue will be represented with a slice type, and Iâ€™ll expose the

New()
Enqueue()
Dequeue()
Front()
IsEmpty()
Size()

New() serves as the constructor, which initializes the internal slice when we start using it.

enqueue()	This function defines the operation for adding an element into queue.
dequeue()	This function defines the operation for removing an element from queue.
Front	Front is used to get the front data item from a queue.
Rear	Rear is used to get the last item from a queue.
